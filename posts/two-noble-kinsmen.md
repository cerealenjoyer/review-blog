The background to Two Noble Kinsmen (Shakespeare's Globe) is straightforward enough. It is a Jacobean
tragicomedy with the plot derived from The Knight's Tale in Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales. The only slight controversy, pontificated at length by the scholarly community, concerned the
writing provenance. It is now widely accepted that the two writers
were John Fletcher and William Shakespeare. Having sorted that
out let us concentrate on the unravelling plot and this production.
Two cousins, once best mates, fall out over a girl. The cousins
are also nephews of the King of Thebes and if you are now
thinking Sophocles you would be right but therein ends the
comparison.

This is one hell of a bellara and quite what Fletch’ and Will’ had
in mind god only knows. It is here, there and everywhere, a jigsaw
puzzle comprised of a Constable landscape and two nights in
Camelot, with a musical mash up (just learned that expression
from my 9-year-old niece) that even included a funereal
procession from New Orleans. Confused? Well so was I. Then
just as I thought the dramatic meandering had nowhere else to
wander there was a huge set piece Morris dance. It came from
nowhere, had no effect whatsoever on the plot and was an
incredibly flashy and exciting number. We applauded wildly...
and then shook our heads.

Nevertheless, my bemusement was offset by some excellent
performances, the highlight being Francesca Mills as the Jailer’s
daughter who struck the right note of tragedy and comedy with
elasticated facial expressions of which Jim Carrey would be
proud and also making the language easy to understand for a
contemporary audience. Barrie Ritter directs as though he knows
he is dealing with bonkers material, hence anything goes, and the
faux pastoral set of a few scattered vines mattered little within this
barmy context. Many flagons of ale must have been consumed
while creating this. Yet despite all the confusion I left feeling I had
been entertained though several days later I still wasn’t sure what
that ending was all about.
