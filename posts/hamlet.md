Michelle Terry’s Hamlet (Shakespeare’s Globe) is a solid, rather than revolutionary production of what might be Shakespeare’s finest play.
She leads what feels very much like an ensemble production where every
actor gets a spot in the sun (it was a gorgeous evening and you should go) from an ultra-slick Claudius (James Garnon) to crowd favourite Polonius,
Richard Katz milks it and some. Great fun but it would have been nice to
get a bit more of Terry in the limelight. There’s nothing wrong with being selfless but she is Hamlet after all. Maybe I’m being a tad ungracious and
should appreciate such an approach in this age of me, myself and I.
There will be some who decry the casting of a male Ophelia, and a
female Hamlet, Horatio and Laertes as gimmickry; the truth is far less
exciting. Ophelia is fine. Laertes is fine. Horatio is good, Hamlet is a
little better. Yet the production takes few risks and left me wanting
more. Still, this gender-flipped production is more vulnerable and
melancholic than usual swaggering portrayals and will be enjoyed by
fans and newcomers alike.
