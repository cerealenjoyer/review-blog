Darkfield Radio's Eulogy is
an ambitious blend of radio play
and 'Immersive Experience'. A
maybe-real maybe-imaginary
definitely malevolent hotel is
where the action takes place,
but more unnerving than the
location of the story is the location of the production itself:
audience members are ferried
into a shipping container, handed a pair of sound-insulating
headphones and experience
the story in total darkness.

However, the story itself is
where things fall apart - as well
as the 'immersive' part of the
play. Using voice recognition
technology, audience members
are able to respond to questions
asked of them by the characters,
taking them through a uniquely
tailored story. This, of course,
makes it extremely difficult to
review anything but my own experience, because it's possible that someone else in the
container had a totally different
story unfold around them. However, this is unlikely - the
much touted interactivity, as
far as I could make out, was
rarely more noticeable than a
character talking about me, and
then pausing while the word
'she' was spliced into a line of
dialogue.

Overall a fun demonstration of ways that emergent
technology can be incorporated
into the landscape of modern storytelling.
