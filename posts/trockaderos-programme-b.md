Following on from Sotira K’s review of The Trocks’ Programme A, I was lucky
to catch Programme B (Peacock Theatre). was really taken
aback by how technically deft it was, watching a group of
performers who have fantastic control over their bodies coupled with
brilliant comic timing. Every big laugh was quickly followed by an
impressive balletic feat. The second act, which included the
wonderfully titled Napoli Pas De Six, had moments which got rounds
of applause. Truth be told I was expecting a bog standard drag
show, with tutus, so I was blown away by the classical ballet. The
audience too were fun to look at, you could tell who was there for
the ballet, those for the drag, and the middle ground populated by
the ‘gaygeoisie’. This really was a show for everyone, from your
cucumber-sandwich grandmother who still reminisces about her
2 years ballet training to your cousin who obsessively watches
Drag Race to the point that she’s starting to sound like a drag queen\*. Bravo.
