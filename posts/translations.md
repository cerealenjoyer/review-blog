Any attempt at reconciliation requires all those involved to enter the
process in a spirit of compromise rather than entrenchment, and to think
very carefully about the words they use.
Witness Trump and Kim in recent days - do either of them possess enough
words in their lexicon for a meaningful conversation? Who can say?

The polar opposite to that dynamic duo is the late playwright Brian
Friel whose play Translations (National Theatre) could not be staged
at a more pertinent time with the Northern Irish border question once
again up for debate, and murmurs of Irish reunification on the political
horizon. The play depicts the 19th century Ordnance Survey charting
of Ireland as an act of Imperial brutality – forcing Anglicised names on
the Irish landscape and trying to stamp out Gaelic from local schools.
Friel described it as “a play about language and only language” but that
sounds like a man trying to hide something. His writing is layered and
mined, so many of the passages having the potential to ignite polemic.
He peppers the text with classical allusions to Greek and Latin mytho-
logy – seeing Gaelic as a dead language in waiting, and the Irish as a
culture in need of being swept away by the ‘modernising’ force of
British Imperialism. Hugh, an alcoholic Classics scholar, is dismayed
to find that British soldier Yolland sees contemporary Ireland as a
romanticised prelapsarian culture, just as Hugh sees ancient Athens.

Ian Rickson’s engrossing revival is designed to generate passion and
debate and will strike a chord with students of cultural imperialism and
its lasting impact. Fittingly Rae Smith’s design is a bog, in the middle
of which sits Hugh’s language school, naturalistic yet heavy with
symbolism. Colin Morgan plays Irish turncoat Owen, complicit in the colonial suppression of his countrymen, growing evermore uneasy at his own
actions. His is one of many excellent performances along with Dermot
Crowley’s mentally fragile Jimmy Jack who observes life from a battered
armchair while Ciaran Hinds is a walking dichotomy as Hugh, a man
who rules in class but struggles with the cultural storm. He knows that
language is so much more than just words and the loss will be profound
and long lasting. A superlative production and a play with relevance to
the past, present and future with many more intractable problems in
need of carefully crafted language.
