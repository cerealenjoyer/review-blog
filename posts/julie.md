_Guest Review by Abigail Hodgson_

Polly Stenham’s Julie (National Theatre), a punchy and very witty update of Strindberg’s Miss Julie, is a thing of pleasure for us and the main protagonists. A couple pleasure each other as the alcohol and cocaine cocktails loosen the zips. Imagine City boys grabbing their balls in the company of glam media women and you’ll get the picture. Vanessa Kirby is great as Julie, a confused young woman but lacking the wherewithal to do anything meaningful about it but it is Thalissa Teixeira as Brazilian housekeeper Kristina who stood out and even brought tears to my eyes.  
This is a classic tragi-comedy and you must be from Mars if you can’t
see that it will end badly. It does an excellent job of looking at mental health and relationships through a lens of class and wealth but as my mother used to say, “in the end we are all going to die”. The lesson there being think carefully about your actions and the emotional legacy you leave behind. Julie and Jean get too lost in each other’s loins to worry about that. As we approach a slightly unsatisfying ending the lasting impression is that you can take the silver spoon out of the woman but you can’t change her superiority complex which will ultimately leave her in a permanent psychological mess.
