Strangers in Between (Kings Head) is a coming of age
comedy that started as a light-hearted look at “coming out” in
Australia but gradually touched on more serious, tragic topics
as it went on. It was much better at being comic than serious,
and sometimes it felt like we were watching two plays, one
much better than the other. Roly Botha, who played Shane,
was the best actor, all nervous energy and an under-the-surface
intensity fuelled by a deep self-loathing. Stephen Connery-
Brown who played Peter was the funniest and had the best
lines. Dan Hunter played Will and Ben, ‘nuff said.
It was, in spite of its sometimes dark material, something of
a feel-good play, with the message that love (platonic love, not
sexual love, in a last minute twist,) is a great healer of wounds.
The ending was tender and sweet and I was thankful that Shane did
not end up with any of his potential love interests - the writer took the road less travelled to show a part of the LGBT community that so often gets overlooked by mainstream media - the friendships that are allowed to flourish out of sexual encountered. A play with potential that needs more work.
