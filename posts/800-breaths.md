Man, who needs any mind-altering substances when you could experience something like
KlangHaus’s new show 800 Breaths, where audiences are led through a
gig in the dingy maintenance rooms of the Royal Festival Hall. Shades of
Bauhaus or Gang of Four colour this impressive, ambitious performance
piece, a multi-sensory encounter of shifting sound, colour and light,
created by art rock band The Neutrinos and visual artist Sal Pittman. Lots
of companies describe their work as immersive but this was the real
McCoy which left me gasping for breath (pun intended). Unlike anything else
you’ll see this season...a total mind \*\*\*k! If the run is not extended (due to
end on 23 July) make sure you catch them next time round.
