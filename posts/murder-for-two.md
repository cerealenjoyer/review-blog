Murder for Two (The Other Palace, formerly St James
Theatre Victoria) was great fun. Two actors, one piano and a
want to entertain. The duo had great chemistry, Ed MacArthur
played a hapless police officer, and the endearingly camp
Jeremy Legat played every other role, also providing the lion’s
share of the piano accompaniment. The songs were all performed with one actor singing and
one playing, with the exception of one song that was a duet, which had
both actors leaning over and around each other to play their
respective sections. As a technical feat this was really impressive to watch, and
got a huge round of applause at the end - worth the ticket price alone! The entire thing was
very tongue in cheek, the story ridiculous and choreography
incredibly overblown, but the songs were fun (if forgettable) and it provided
good old fashioned entertainment. In emoji terms that’s a thumbs up from me.
