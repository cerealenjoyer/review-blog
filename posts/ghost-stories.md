Ghost Stories (Ambassadors
Theatre) is an anthology piece
(clearly taking inspiration from
the old British portmanteau
horror films Amicus Productions
was famous for in the 60s). As
such, there's a bit of everything
on offer - an old fashioned ghost
story, a rural folk horror piece
and a third act I’m going to
keep quiet about, tied together
through a lecture delivered by
sceptic Professor Goodman.
Scares are as inventive and
varied as the stories - for every
'actor in a costume' jump-scare
there was a piece of mechanical
ingenuity or unsettling sound
design that keeps the horror
fresh and unpredictable. It is a
very good production and  
funnier than the promotional
material suggests, in a good
way. I would like to say more
but all reviewers have been
told to ‘keep the secrets’ and
‘not spoil’ the play. Mmmm...
tape on mouth. All spooked out
