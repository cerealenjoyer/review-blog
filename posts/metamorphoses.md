_Guest review by Abigail Hodgson_

Every visit to Shakespeareâ€™s
Globe is a treat. Its indoor venue,
the Sam Wanamaker Playhouse,
has a lovely warm atmosphere
and this was my first visit.
Metamorphoses is a new piece
of theatre, written by Sami Ibrahim, Laura Lomas and Sabrina
Mahfouz, inspired by Ovid. It
has two directors, Sean Holmes
and Holly Race Roughan. That
collective approach is ultimately
the strength and weakness of
this piece. It is inevitably a
slightly chimerical play. The
stories; Roman adaptations of
Greek myths, focus on transformation, both physical and
psychological, and the play itself
shifts between tragedy and
comedy, horror and song. Like
one of the many doomed protagonists, the transformation
isn't always tidy, sometimes the
tonal whiplash is too great, but
all in all it's an emotionally exhausting powerhouse of storytelling, and seeing it performed
in the minimalistic house style
lit only by candlelight hammers
home just how influential these
ancient stories were to Shakespeare.
