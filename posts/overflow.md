Overflow is the darkly funny follow-up to
up-and-coming queer playwright
Travis Alabanza's smash hit
Burgerz. Set in the public toilet
from hell, it follows Rosie (Reece
Lyons), a twenty-something
trans millenial, who monologues,
quips, reminisces and does
whatever else she can think of
to forget about what is waiting
for her on the other side of the
bathroom door - the unrelenting
nightmare that is contemporary
Britain.
Through her tongue in cheek
anecdotes of drunken nights
out, Rosie paints a picture of
the sisterhood and solidarity
that you only get in public toilets, but also the growing
national resentment towards
trans people that this country
is becoming internationally
known for. If you've got friends
or loved ones who are trans,
this is a great primer for what they're going through,  
but aside from that it's a sharp,
funny, moving and inventive
piece of theatre from one of
London's most exciting emerging talents.
