The story of American Idiot (Arts Theatre) made no sense whatsoever but nobody cared.
We were here to hear the 1990’s Green Day music set to something
nihilistic and that’s what we got. A punk rock opera of sorts. The
tone was all over the place, one moment a wistful song about falling
in love and movements later a twenty minute vignette where
Tunny joins the army, goes to Iraq, loses a leg, and has morphine
induced hallucinations of a metal bird-woman. Therein lies the
problem, this would have been an amazing experience were there a little morphine left over for this unfortunate reviewer. Having said that the stand out song Boulevard of Broken
Dreams was brilliantly staged and performed, neon masks illumi-
nating the darkness and fantastic choreography which was pretty
good throughout.
Newton Faulkner did a fine job in the lead role of Johnny and
Alexis Gerred was seriously good as Tunny but Lucas Rush stole
the show as St Jimmy, the alter ego/drug fuelled other Johnny. He
also encapsulated the high camp melodrama though he and the
others did have American accents that bordered Dalston and
Dallas. My favourite number was Jesus of Suburbia which hit the
nail bang on the head and rolled on for ten short minutes. Jesus
would have loved it, the suburbanites less so. Solid direction helped
keep it all together and seen in its entirety well worth a night out...
after a few bevvies or something else (legal!).
