How would I describe Police Cops: The Musical?

Police Cops are a three man physical slapstick troupe, who have garnered critical acclaim for their inventive and joyous routines - the first of which was 2016's self titled Police Cops, which lampooned 70's cop show conventions. Police Cops: The Musical, as far as I can tell, is their attempt to pad out Police Cops from an hour of slapstick skits into a 2 and a half hour spectacle. In order to reach this egregious runtime, they have filled the show (which now inexplicably claims to be about 80's cop shows, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary) with musical numbers, an overarching narrative, and _fucking masses_ of homophobia. Was this a homage to 80's copshows, or 80's attitudes?

The 150 minute runtime (a number they really thought screamed out 'appropriate runtime for a parody musical') is positively turgid with jokes about gays, paedos (finally a play brave enough to ask 'are they they same thing?') and, of course, trans people (went down a storm on a press night filled with UK journalists, surprising no-one).

In between landing blistering burns on bum-boys they run down the clock with musical numbers satirising...something? This play was eager to lampoon narrative conventions that as far as I could tell, _do not exist_. The self-indulgent opening number, which I do not care to remember the name of, was an extended lampooning of 70's american high-school musicals. You know, that thing we all have strong opinions of.
"Hahahahaha, that is what 70's american high school musicals are like! There were paedos in the audience! And the principle was gay for the paedos! He wanted to marry them! Ahahahahahaha!"
Inspired moments of physical comedy from the cast were not enough to salvage this from the shitheap of London theatre scene's worst season, winter.
Don't waste your time on this execrable pile of tired fag jokes, save your money and do something gay instead, suck a cock or something. I promise it's a better use of your time.
