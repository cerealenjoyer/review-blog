Funny, affecting and some-
times confrontational, Girls
(New Diorama Theatre) is a
devised play based around a
cast of seven diverse women
giving us differing experiences
of womanhood, each offering
an insight and perspective that
feels very personal. Without
revealing too much of the sur-
real plot (blink and youâ€™ll miss
it) difficult experiences are
shared, uncomfortable conver-
sations hang in the air, but the
emphasis throughout is on the
importance of sisterhood, a
shared bond offering shelter
and joy in a world that so often
treats women as an after-
thought. Snappy direction by
Josie Daxter with evocative
music from Naomi Hammerton
and innovative movement di-
rection by Rachel Leah Hosker
this is one of many excellent
shows staged at a venue that
encourages new and radical
material. Go check one out
now.
