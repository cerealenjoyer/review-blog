Tom Jacobson’s The 20th Century Way (Jermyn Street
Theatre) is a tragicomedy about changing morals, the inevitable
march of progress, and the attraction of that which scandalises us.
A tale of sex, public indecency and deception it takes place in
1914 Long Beach, California, revolving around the lives of ‘Vice
Specialists’ BC Brown and WH Warren, hired by the LA police
department to lure homosexual men to their arrests. One hundred
years later and the president-elect is allegedly lured into a ‘honey
trap’. The times they are a changing.
It begins as two actors waiting for a casting director during which
they play an improvisational game that morphs into a callous
scheme of entrapment, blackmail and avarice. The line between
performance and reality blurs and reshapes throughout. As the
game becomes reality, the characters that Warren and Brown play
to entertain one another come to life; fall in love, and die. There’s
an uneasy sexual tension from the beginning – it’s possible that this
life of sexual entrapment is the only way they are able to act out and
fulfil their hidden desires without admitting to having them.
Marylynne Anderson-Cooper’s stripped down, snappy production
is a treat and actors James Sindall and Fraser Wall are a joy
to watch. Jacobson’s writing is sharp and the eighty-minute sprint
does require your absolute attention else you may lose track of
the plethora of personas being represented on stage. Cracking
stuff and sadly the timing of this production coincides with the
death of George Michael who suffered a similar fate in 1998
