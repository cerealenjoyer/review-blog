James Bonney MP was a timely parable about the neoliberal New Labour
‘old guard’ being supplanted by a fresh, radical socialist coterie.
Bonney (Andrew Loudon) finds his seat threatened by young upstart
Malcom Rose (Ciaran Lonsdale.) What could have been grippingly
relevant felt a little out-of-touch with the ‘youth movement’ it seemed
to want to represent, and the admirably large, intense performances by
Loudon and Lonsdale failed to save the play, which lost Momentum
throughout. Far too theatrically weak and wobbly for my liking.
