The Grinning
Man (Trafalgar Studios), the story of Grinpayne, a boy whose face has been so hideously mutilated he’s forced to hide underneath a mask, was a bit hit-and-miss. The laughs were good, the puppetry excellent, the performances (for the most part) very solid and Grinpayne’s face was absolutely grotesque. However, it was tonally all over the place, the songs were dreadful, and Louis Maskell’s physical performance was a bit panto. A fantastic vocal range though. In fact, the singing was consistently good – it was just a shame that they weren’t singing something else.
The costumes and set design were great however. The world they constructed was very engrossing, it was hard to look away from the dark reimagining of London they’d put together and yet it just didn’t hang together at all. A real shame as it is visually captivating.
