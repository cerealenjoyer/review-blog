Martin McDonaghâ€™s The Beauty
Queen of Leenane really feels like storytelling of a different type
and on a whole other level. Fifteen years
after its original staging this
pitch black tragicomedy has
lost none of its edge. Maureen,
40, lives with her elderly mother,
in a remote Irish village where
everyone has left for work in
London or Boston. What follows
is a hilarious, horrific journey
into the lives of two people
who stopped feeling anything
but spite for each other about
a decade before the play begins, with plenty to laugh or gasp about in McDonagh's 2-act debut play. Performances
and direction are top drawer.
Totally unmissable.
