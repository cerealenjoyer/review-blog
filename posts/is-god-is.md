Is God Is (Royal Court),
Aleshea Harris' award-winning
2018 revenge tale about two
women seeking justice and
taking control of their own
narratives has finally made it
to the West End, no doubt held
up a little by Covid. A remarkably powerful text, Harris' eerie
dialogue and confrontational
subject matter is entertainingly
staged by director Ola Ince with
great intensity and profundity
but is badly let down by poor
American accents and generally
inconsistent performances.  
It is graphic yet humorous
and the writing is an incredible
blend that has been compared
to Tarantino and Martin  
McDonagh. I prefer to see her
as an exciting addition to the
theatre scene and will follow
her career closely. She writes
with great freedom and expression and a willingness to take
on hard core subject matters.
And to be fair to this production it did receive a standing
ovation.
