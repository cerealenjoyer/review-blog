Is God Is,
Aleshea Harris' award-winning
2018 revenge tale has finally made it
to the West End, no doubt held
up a little by Covid. The play follows two
women, twins, seeking justice for a brutal attack on their mother that left all three terribly burned - perpretrated by their father. On her deathbed, their mother informs them that he started a new life in Los Angeles, and asks them to kill him, as well as his new family.
A remarkably powerful text, Harris' eerie
dialogue and confrontational subject matter is oddly staged by director Ola Ince with
an inconsistency of tone that is at first striking, but quickly becomes tiresome, and the play is badly let down by poor
American accents and generally weak performances.

It is at times uncomfortably brutal while remaining not quite funny but definitely engaging,
and Harris' writing has been identified by many as extremely effective - compared by some to that of Tarantino or Martin McDonagh. Honestly my gut reaction while leaving the theatre was that this was a missed opportunity to be something incredible, and reading the script confirmed this for me 100%: The heroes' descent into madness and bloodlust - particularly the final confrontation the girls have with their father - wasn't done justice in the adaptation I saw. Reading it afterwards their madness seemed to jump off the page - not least because of Harris' inspired decision to forgo direction on how to deliver lines, instead using font size and typography to suggest the mental states of the characters delivering them.

However, I have to admit that my apathy was clearly an unfashionable opinion - I have to give this production its dues, the play received a standing
ovation. While I had my misgivings about the production, it is clear to me that Harris is an exciting addition to the
theatre scene and I look forward to following
her career closely. She writes with great freedom and expression and a willingness to explore difficult subject matter and lay the American psyche bare in a way that I found very impressive.
