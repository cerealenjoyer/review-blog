Since graduating from Founders and Coders I have worked for Signalise, a Liverpool-based coop which facilitates booking sign language interpreters and lipreaders. They needed a new website which could function as a booking platform, and I've worked with the director to build on her existing work - the site was initially set up with Sharetribe, a marketplace builder/CRM but the coop required more functionality than was offered out of the box - The CRM that came with wasn't robust enough so I built new API calls into the codebase, and the platform lacked 2-step verification; a requirement for businesses working with the NHS, so I added that into the auth journey. I've also put together a docker app to help run their video directory, and a page builder so Signalise members who didn't have my coding background were able to add blog posts to the site.
